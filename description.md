# Description of work

To make my application I used this environment:

Editor: Sublime Text 3
SO: Elementary Linux
Python 3.5

My SublimeText 3 has a plugin called "Python Flake8 Lint" that help me to code with the PEP8 conventions, showing where is the errors and how to correct.

I have forked the proposed git repository and work in my fork normally.

No more libs was necessary except django-dotenv, that read the .env files and put the configuration in environment variables.

Basically the major work was mount the models structure integrated with the django-rest-framework, to work like expected.
